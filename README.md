Transport Software for Competitive Bidding
**Transport Arrangements**  
The supervisor will call each transporter as needed and finalise vehicles for dispatch on a daily basis. The scope for reaching out to transporters is limited, necessitating contracts at fixed rates for extended periods.



**Steps Taken**  
We have developed Transporter Software that allows the supervisor to post requirements according to demand. Transporters can quote their rates for each destination. After a few hours, transporters receive an alert with the lowest bid received for each destination, giving them an opportunity to resubmit their rates. This process encourages competition among transporters. 

After another few hours, based on the revised rates, the lowest rate is finalised. The chosen transporter must organise the vehicle within 24 hours of finalisation. If they fail to do so, the second-lowest bid will be accepted, and the additional cost will be charged to the first transporter for not providing the truck despite confirmation.

This system has led to better rates, effectively reducing transportation costs.

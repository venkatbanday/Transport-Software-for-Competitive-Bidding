# Transport Software for Competitive Bidding

**Overview:**  
Transport was managed manually with limited outreach and pre-negotiated rates, leading to inefficiencies.

**Steps Taken:**  
- Developed a custom transport software allowing rate bidding.
- Introduced alert system for resubmission of lower bids.
- Enforced service-level agreements with escalation clauses.

**Results:**  
- Reduced freight costs by 18%.
- Improved vendor competition and reliability.
- Ensured dispatch integrity and system transparency.
